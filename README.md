Across multiple businesses and organizations globally, customers expect quick resolution to service related issues and prompt assistance to any high priority queries or escalations they come across. In most of the cases, the field personnel are not equipped to provide prompt response to customer requests. The **Rapid Assist** app helps in overcoming such situations by enabling such customer facing associates to connect with corporate liaisons (SME) and get their queries resolved with a quick response time ensuring enhanced customer satisfaction and experience and as a result improve brand loyalty.

The solution is suite of **two**  **apps** - **Rapid Assist** app for field personnel, **Rapid Assist-Experts** app for Corporate liaisons, thereby servicing the needs of multiple personas.

Here are a few key features:

-   Connect now - For any support that the customer services representative may need while responding to customer, the 'Connect now' feature of the app helps in calling the Subject Matter Expert and getting back to the customer with a prompt answer.

-   Search topics - The search feature provides the service associates with a quick reference guide, to be able to resolve the customer queries faster.

-   Subject Matter Experts (SME) have the access to generate and share the resolution to a customer query, thus saving time and efforts.

-   Follow up with SME's on any open requests.

-   Allows experts to receive notifications to quickly get on a call with customer service associates to help resolve queries.
